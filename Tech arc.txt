Christopher Smith
This orchestration layer is basically for each service it's automatically generated through.
Christopher Smith
Sure, our bedroom service registry.
Christopher Smith
So when the guys are developing the services, they register their services in this mid range service registry. It generates this code on the mainframe side.
Christopher Smith
It also generates the interface on the midrange side, so it sorta marries it up.
Christopher Smith
So that's something that doesn't need to be developed. It just needs to.
Christopher Smith
It's automatically popped out of the midrange service registry.
Christopher Smith
And then once we get through this data conversion layer and orchestration layer, it then goes and runs the 1st.
Christopher Smith
Business Application program which is which is your service.
Christopher Smith
So in this particular particular case, it'll probably be looking up.
Christopher Smith
It's doing a search for clients.
Christopher Smith
I'll be looking up some some client information given the the information that was being provided and if it finds something or finds something or if it doesn't find something
Christopher Smith
I'll be looking up some some client information given the the information that was being provided and if it finds something or finds something or if it doesn't find something, it'll be then going back down the same flow and sending and then we we send a reply message back.
Christopher Smith
With the information that's being found.
Christopher Smith
So that's in a very high level how interactive work 111 message



Christopher Smith
So when you're talking about your services and stuff like that, having limits and stuff like that.
Christopher Smith
If, if it's gonna be run interactively, the the limit is probably 3 seconds. We want it to give you run within 3 seconds, because otherwise you'll get timeouts and stuff like that.
Christopher Smith
But there's there's other ways you can run services as well.
Christopher Smith
So that's that's just the 1st way interactively.
Christopher Smith
The other thing you probably should be aware of.
Christopher Smith
That as is as far as error handling, if anywhere anywhere within this business application, we hit an error.
Christopher Smith
Control gets taken back to the to the tech arch layer and what we do is we send a.
Christopher Smith
We will send a response back to say that there's been an error so that the online user will know that there's an error.
Christopher Smith
It it it may not be interpreted to well on the on the midrange side sometimes you get a screen of death but you will get a response back to say that there's there's an error somewhere



Christopher Smith
And that's the core thing about when we talk about performance, the performance main performance hits on anything is accessing the database because every.





Netra Rai
Sorry, this is probably a really dumb question. When when you say or when people say you know there's a batch and then there's service, what's what's the difference or what's the example of that? You know, like like service for example here. When you say service, what exactly are?
Netra Rai
We talking about?
Christopher Smith
OK, so a service is basically just like a like a component.
Christopher Smith
So it's it.
Christopher Smith
It's it's doing some sort of business function we use.
Christopher Smith
We use this service level architecture in all of our models, so you'll you'll see it in all of our models.
Christopher Smith
So the back end always has a service hanging off it.
Christopher Smith
But there's other things driving it. So in this in this instance we've got. It's just an online user.
Christopher Smith
So that's why we call it interactive, because we we're expecting to have.
Christopher Smith
An online user driving it and we it's a high priority service.
Christopher Smith
Because we wanna give the response back in a quick manner because they're still they hang on them, hanging on their monitor, waiting for a response.
Christopher Smith
If.
Netra Rai
If we if I were to dumb it down a bit, can I say a services just like you know bunch of function code to do a certain task is that is that. Yep. Oh OK, perfect.
Christopher Smith
That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.




Christopher Smith
So and that will just be be be be loaded on this queue and what what we have is a ticket program here that's basically the driver we call the bulk destructive reader and it will go through and it will process each message one at a time. So first.



Christopher Smith
OK, but yeah, so they'll be called if so if there's, say 10,000 messages on this queue, this service will get called 10,000 times.
Netra Rai
Yep.
Christopher Smith
One so each message if it's. If it's basically a message for one message for per client.
Christopher Smith
Each each client will get processed sequentially.
Christopher Smith
OK.
Christopher Smith
So.
Christopher Smith




Christopher Smith
The error handling is a bit different here as well, so if there is an error, there's no point in sending of this.
Christopher Smith
Main point in sending it back to the sender because I don't think they know what to do with it.
Christopher Smith
So what we do is we send it to EAI and they have an error handling database.
Christopher Smith
So all the errors get sort stored there and potentially if it's something that can be fixed, they can replay them. And so that's quite a handy way of ensuring that things get processed because.
Christopher Smith
Sometimes we just get data database contention because two processes are trying to read this.
Christopher Smith
Read the same table here. The database contention store on the error handling database.
Christopher Smith
Try it again.
Christopher Smith
So there's rules associated with that error handling database to determine whether they.
Christopher Smith
Replay the messages or not.



Christopher Smith
So that's it's sort of like a like a yeah, I've I've added assurance to make sure that we we're actually processing everything that was sent. So that's something that's in in the framework that that our team actually maintains.
Christopher Smith
Well, in conjunction with the AIAI, actually look after the actual contents we we provide the program to generate it.
Christopher Smith
So it's just an give you an extra assurance that.
Christopher Smith
That when you're processing something 'cause if we've got two phases here we've got a EAI process and we've got a service process.
Christopher Smith
So we wanna make sure that those processes.
Christopher Smith
Those messages actually match account add up, so we're processing the same amount that has been sent, and we do that. We we do that in multiple levels because I'm just looking at a simple example here where we've got a service running, but this service could be quite complic.
Christopher Smith
It could be another process that goes off and calls another service.
Christopher Smith
And it could be.
Christopher Smith
It could be calling that fire MQ as well, so we can get these multiple layers of BBC Records where we've got processes calling another process calling another process.
Christopher Smith
So we want to get some sort of reconciliation across that to make sure that it all adds up.
Christopher Smith
So that's what BBC is.
Christopher Smith
In a nutshell, without going.
Netra Rai
Yeah, that's yeah, that's good.
Netra Rai
That's good. That's good.
Mohammad Hossain3
The quick quick question, quick question.
Mohammad Hossain3
So BPC doesn't use the queue queue system. Is it because of the performance or any other reason?
Christopher Smith
No no




Christopher Smith
It's used by ICP. It was supposed to be used the enterprise architecture, just tried to roll it out to all external systems like midrange systems, but that sort of hasn't really worked all that well, primarily because they don't want to. They don't want to follow our rules, I.
Christopher Smith
Mean. I understand that because well, half the time they probably don't even know our rules.
Christopher Smith
So so it it hasn't really worked that well.
Christopher Smith
It it's it's good for us to reconcile things on the ICP side, but.
Christopher Smith
How the areas have been hesitant to to use it, so it is limited. Other areas like I know.
Christopher Smith
Data hub.
Christopher Smith
They actually have their own reconciliation process





Christopher Smith
There's three types of ref data.
Christopher Smith
We've got our own tick arc ref data.
Christopher Smith
There's also what we call business ref data.
Christopher Smith
So the stuff that the business people use on their business, application programmes and the third type of REF data is forms ref data. So the things that they set up for configuring forms so 33 separate areas of ref data in ICP.
Christopher Smith
Yeah.
Christopher Smith
Cool, cool.
Christopher Smith




Christopher Smith
So we have a a batch program, a batch driver program calling a business application batch program and what we're doing in these in this batch processing is basically we're extracting stuff.
Christopher Smith
To be sent through to be processed as a service for, potentially for each client, OK.
Christopher Smith
So in this particular example, we're we're going to be running credit balances.
Christopher Smith
So this batch process will be running through the database, picking out all the credit balance cases that need to be processed.
Christopher Smith
As they're doing that, they then call this this program called the service invoke, which then for each client that you actually want to actually process it will then go on generate.
Christopher Smith
A message on a queue to be sent through to the service and the service is basically the same structure as all the other services it's been going to be be processed under a batch OK.
Christopher Smith
So for each.
Christopher Smith
So for here we're running a batch process.
Christopher Smith
It's potentially running through through our database, picking out all the credit balance cases, so it's only in this case it's only extracting them.



Christopher Smith
It then puts them into amqi's individual messages, so as we're processing the.
Christopher Smith
This could build up.
Christopher Smith
These keys could build up and there could be thousands of messages coming in coming through and as as they're coming through, this driver program is picking them up and processing them individually.
Christopher Smith
Two, two things to be aware of here. In this extract part there's no updates, so we don't want to do any major updates.
Christopher Smith
We're just extracting and the reason behind that is it because it's being run as a batch process.
Christopher Smith
We don't want to have any locks.
Christopher Smith
Because this stuff is doing all the updates and potentially we have the batch process mocking the update process OK.
Christopher Smith
So no updates in this in this part.
Christopher Smith
Send it through.
Christopher Smith
And this part does all the updates.
Christopher Smith
Same as the bulk as well, if if we wanted to get a reply back potentially we could, but most batch processes which is done processing just extract it, process it. We don't know about it.
Christopher Smith
So most most batch processes don't have a reply, but if if there is an error.
Christopher Smith
Like potentially could be replayed as well.
Christopher Smith
So very similar to the bulk, it's being generated off ICP itself.
Netra Rai
Now



Christopher Smith
And that's the thing that we provide as part of the framework 'cause, as I said we we we you don't have to build this stuff because it's part of the framework that we provide. So and everybody's using it.
Christopher Smith
So that's that's that's the common common benefit of having a common framework is that we've it's something that's already set up for you.
Christopher Smith
You don't need to worry about it.
Christopher Smith
It's tested.
Christopher Smith
It's tried and all that sort of thing.
Netra Rai
No, sorry, my question, my question was more about what sort of information or data sort of flows through that you know until Yep.
Christopher Smith
Yeah, OK. Yeah.
Christopher Smith
It it does vary because it it depends on what.
Christopher Smith
What? Like what?
Christopher Smith
What sort of processing you're you're doing?
Christopher Smith
So in this case, we're talking about credit balance stuff. So I'm assuming this would be sort of like credit balance processing.
Christopher Smith
Yeah. So it'd be.
Christopher Smith
It'd be different leakage areas, so this is where you actually can put in your own linkage area.
Christopher Smith
So each each batch application would have separate linkage.
Netra Rai
Yep, Yep.
Netra Rai
OK, now I can.
Christopher Smith
But yeah and even the format of the stuff on the queue it's it's it's



Christopher Smith
And that this is where the that BBBC comes into play. Because when when they're running these, they're running them under a a schedule on on on, on the mainframe which which is run looked after by our mainframe operators.
Christopher Smith
So if there's, if there's any problem with this batch process as it's running, it will flag an alert to the operator to say, hey, there's been an error.
Christopher Smith
You basically need to ring somebody up and and and do something about it.
Christopher Smith
So that's, that's where this JCL comes into play.
Netra Rai
Yep.
Christopher Smith
Because it it will actually alert the operators that there's there's been a failure somewhere.
